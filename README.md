# Food Ordering App

This is a Food Ordering App built using the [Getx](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx) library for efficient state management. Getx provides a simple and powerful solution for managing reactive state, navigation, and dependencies in Flutter applications.

For the backend, the app utilizes the popular [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework. Laravel is a robust PHP framework that offers a wide range of features for building scalable and secure web applications. With Laravel, the app benefits from a solid foundation for handling complex backend functionalities, such as user authentication, API integrations, and database management.
